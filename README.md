Why Resolve?
Resolve‚Äôs mission is to share the Problems and grow the world‚Äôs solutions. A vast amount of the solutions that would be valuable to many people is currently only available to a few ‚Äî either locked in people‚Äôs heads, or only accessible to some groups. We want to connect the people who have solutions to the people who need it, to bring together people with different prospective's of solutions for different types of problems so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their problems for the benefit of the rest of the world.
